            <div class="biography">
                <p>My Name is Bryn Winningham, and I am a licensed cosmatologist. Similar to many women, I was tired of putting on maskerra on and dealing with all of that hassel.  So, I decided to use my education from Tulsa Tech in cosmatology to start doing something about it.  Now, its been about 6 months of lashing full time, its one of my biggest hobbies and is helping me pay for my college education.  One of the biggest reasons I chose lashes was to be able to help enhance people's natural beauty so that they can feel better about themselves.  I am currently lashing in Stillwater, OK.  If you have any questions or concerns feel free to message me at (918)-508-5838.  Also go support me and see previous lashes I've done on instagram @Lasheswithbryn.
